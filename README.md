# WemosD1R1_
i've created program that uses standar LiquidCrystal library to implement kepadshield same as you would use for arduino uno R3 but for Wemos D1 R1
note that analog voltage reference on esp8266 is 3,3 V so you may not be able to read some of your buttons corretly, to fix that you might add some resistance to make voltage divide and that should make the job for you
